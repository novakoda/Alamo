# The Alamo
### An Arma 3 Mission By JR Nova

Survive each wave of enemies, that gets harder and harder each wave. Vehicles and snipers spawn in the later rounds. Earn cash from killing enemies that you can spend on upgrading your base, pop-a-perks or support. If you die, you can't respawn until the end of the wave. If all players die, the wave is lost and resets.

## REQUIREMENTS
None but choosing an enemy faction of RHS Russians requires RHS AFRF and GREF


## BUGS
Sometimes an AI group will spawn and not move. If this happens, either you can use the UAV to find and kill them or use the action on the debug laptop at base to advance the level.
No cash reward from destroying vehicles sometimes.
NOTE: You don't get the bonus for completing the wave if you advance with the debug laptop.


## CUSTOM FACTIONS
To use custom factions, open classNames.sqf and scroll down to "case (6)". You'll need to enter the classnames for enemy clothes, armor, weapons & vehicles. You can add as many items as you want or one, but the arrays can't be left empty or there will be errors.
